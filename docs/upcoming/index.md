# Upcoming Features

Some of the upcoming features in the bot. Even if i miss something, the stuff here will sure come to the bot.

## Database

currently some of the data are not stored in a proper database, which is not reliable. Im currently learning
and will be using databases soon, in order to keep the data safe and secure.

The main data that will be moved is:

- Dm command opting position
- Blacklist system. (currently not implemented)

## Raw Message

I'm thinking of making a command that shows the raw message in JSON format. I really dont know if
this would be helpful or anything but I just like it.

A brief explanation of the command

- Sends the message in JSON format
- Sends it in a file
- Would require you to reply to the message you want to view the raw content of
- The command would be split into parts like **`.raw`** **`.rawembed`** etc

An example response would look like this
