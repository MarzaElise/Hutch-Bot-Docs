## Commands

Hutch Bot is filled with awesome automod system and many fun commands and essential moderation commands too!

!!! info
    Even though most commands say No Permissions required, its common sense that most commands need **`send messages`** and **`embed links`** permission to work

- Arguments

    1. `[argument]`
        - An argument surrounded with square brackets denote the argument as **`Optional`**
    2. `<argument>`
        - An argument surrounded with angled brakcets mark the argument as **`Required`**
    3. `[argument]...`
        - If an optional argument ends with `...`, it means that you can pass in as many arguments as you want to. For example, multiple members
    4. `[argument...]`
        - This kind of argument means that the argument consumes all of the content as one argument instead of splitting them into different arguments

    !!! note
        Now that you know these, it should be noted that **__you do NOT type out these brackets__**
